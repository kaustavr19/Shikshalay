<h3>The origin of "Project Shikshalay" dates back to our first year when Kaustav and I were discussing various life problems. Analysing day to day issues and researching how to solve them has always been a passion for me. It was not until the brim of our second year when we decided to resurrect our long lost project and work on it.</h3>

<h3>After a couple of month's hard work, the prototype design was ready. Guess what, people did love our idea. We went to the finals of a <a href="https://bittechfest.in/events/event_details/4a264a745408074c9564d2de555f146b">national level project competition</a>. It was a great feeling for us.</h3>

<h3>Offline instruction is the most preferred and nutritious form of education ever. Often, we meet our relatives or acquaintances asking where did we take our coaching from or if we provide tutoring ourselves. We, as students, also feel the need to be independent of our parents for our daily expenses, ‚Äúpocket money‚Äù. Being a private tutor for four years, I and my friend, Kaustav conceived this ideation based on our experiences and problems we faced both as a student and as a tutor.</h3>
